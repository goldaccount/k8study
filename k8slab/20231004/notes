Pod - Pod (Same Host) Linux Bridge
Pod - Pod (Diff Host) Overlay network (create via CNI)

CNI: Cilium, Calico: use eBPF

Storage

PersistentVolume - persist through pod delete (if pod delete carry to new pod)
StorageClass -> CSI (Container Storage Interface) -> Distributed Storage (via CSI plugin)

Reclaim Policy:  Delete (delete data when delete volume)
use PV Claim to request via StorageClass for resource

If Delete StorageClass -> call Storage to Delete
If Delete STS/DP -> no auto delete PVC

Deployment: PVC's AccessMode: ReadWriteMany
StatefulSet: PVC's AccessMode: ReadWriteOnce - if delete -> unmount then mount to new pod

Dynamic create new depends on different StorageClass (tiers: SSD, HDD, ...)

Rook: Deploy Ceph on K8s
RGW: App Gateway
RBD: Block Device (ReadWriteOnce)
CephFS: File System (ReadWriteMany)
